Java Development Kit (JDK) installation script for Linux
========================================================

"install-java.sh" is an installation script for setting up Java Development Kit (JDK) on Debian based Linux Operating Systems.

Currently, the `install-java.sh` script supports `tar.gz` distributions from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html), [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/) and [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)

I'm mainly using Ubuntu and therefore this script is tested only on Ubuntu versions.

## Prerequisites

The script uses "unzip" command. Therefore, please make sure it is installed.

`sudo apt install unzip`

The "install-java.sh" script will not download the Java distribution. You must download JDK `tar.gz` distribution.

For Oracle JDK 7 & 8, `install-java.sh` supports installing demos and "Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files". This files are picked up from the same directory.

For example, if you want to install Java 7, following files should be downloaded and moved to a single directory.

 - jdk-7u80-linux-x64.tar.gz
 - jdk-7u80-linux-x64-demos.tar.gz
 - UnlimitedJCEPolicyJDK7.zip

Similarly for Java 8, following are the files required

 - jdk-8u212-linux-x64.tar.gz
 - jdk-8u212-linux-x64-demos.tar.gz
 - jce_policy-8.zip

The Java Demos and Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy files are optional. There are no demos from Java 9 upwards. Since Java 9, default JCE policy files already allow for "unlimited" cryptographic strengths.

For any other JDK, you only need to have the Java binary distribution.

## Installation

The script needs to be run as root.

You need to provide the JDK distribution file (`tar.gz`) and the Java Installation Directory. The default value for Java installation directory is "/usr/lib/jvm"

```console
$ sudo ./install-java.sh -h

Usage: 
install-java.sh -f <java_dist> [-p <java_dir>]

-f: The jdk tar.gz file.
-p: Java installation directory. Default: /usr/lib/jvm.
-h: Display this help and exit.

```

Example: Installing Oracle JDK 12

```console
$ sudo ./install-java.sh -f ~/software/java/jdk-12.0.1_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz 
Installing: jdk-12.0.1_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
Extracting /home/isuru/software/java/jdk-12.0.1_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz to /usr/lib/jvm
JDK is extracted to /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-12.0.1
Run update-alternatives commands? [y/N] 
Do you want to set JAVA_HOME environment variable in /home/isuru/.bashrc? [y/N]
```

## Automate Java Installation

You can automate the Java installation script by using the `yes` command.

Example: Installing AdoptOpenJDK 11

`yes | sudo ./install-java.sh -f ~/software/java/OpenJDK11U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot_11.0.3_7.tar.gz`

## Java Mission Control

The installation script will also create a shortcut for Oracle Java Mission Control (JMC).

If the "Welcome" page is blank in JMC, try installing `libwebkitgtk-3.0-0` package.

`sudo apt install libwebkitgtk-3.0-0`

## Uninstallation

There is another script named "uninstall-java.sh" to uninstall Java.

You need to provide Java distribution directory.

```console
$ sudo ./uninstall-java.sh -h

Usage: 
uninstall-java.sh -p <java_dist_dir>

-p: Java distribution directory.
-h: Display this help and exit.
```

Example: Uninstall Oracle JDK 12

`sudo ./uninstall-java.sh -p /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-12.0.1/`
